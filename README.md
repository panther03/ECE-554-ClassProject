# ECE 554 Class Project repository

This repository contains the code for our Spring 2023 ECE554 group project, the Wisconsin Instruments WI-23 graphing calculator.

Group members:

* Julien de Castelnau
* Ayaz Franz
* Elan Graupe
* Aidan McEllistrem
* Madhav Rathi

## Repository Structure

* `doc/`: Contains all documentation related to the project.
* `fpga/`: Contains quartus projects for each board, having their own directory with a Makefile inside. For instance, `fpga/de1_soc`.
* `fw/`: Contains all firmware to be run on the FPGA itself. Assembly files, potentially C files in the future, etc.
* `out/`: A folder autogenerated by the scripts. The memory modules look for the instruction memory listing in this folder, `out.hex`.
* `rtl/`: Contains all of the synthesizable design logic.
* `sw/`: Accessory software to run on the host PC. Automation scripts live here. E.g assembler, testbench runner
* `tb/`: Contains a folder within for each testbench, plus a folder (`tb/pkg/`) for all packages containing tasks,functions,parameters, etc. for the testbenches.
* `tb.json`: A JSON file used by the automation scripts to associate each testbench folder with a top level Verilog module, and a firmware file to automatically build.
